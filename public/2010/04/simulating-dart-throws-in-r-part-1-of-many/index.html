    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Back in November 2009 <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/11/st_darts/">Wired wrote an article </a>about some grad students who decided to try to stochastically model throwing darts. Because I don&rsquo;t actually read printed material I didn&rsquo;t see the article until a couple of months ago. My immediate thought was, &ldquo;hey, I drink beer. I throw darts. I build stochastic models. Why haven&rsquo;t I done this?&rdquo; Well we all know why I haven&rsquo;t done this. I have a job and a 2 year old daughter and I like my wife. Well a funny thing happened a few weeks ago. I sat down and was thinking about this problem and then 5 hours later I had a working dart simulator in my text editor. I don&rsquo;t remember writing this. So <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam&rsquo;s Razor </a>says that the most likely explanation is the simplest explanation. So clearly I was abducted by aliens and someone broke into my office and built a dart simulator.</p>

<p>I do reinsurance modeling to pay the bills and it immediacy hit me that this type of modeling is very similar to what I do for work. This similarity became the impetus for my presentation at <a href="http://www.rinfinance.com/agenda/">R in Finance 2010 </a>which starts today.</p>

<p>I dumped the dart board code into a github gist which can be found here:</p>

<p>[gist id=&ldquo;278148&rdquo;]</p>

<p>If the embedded code is not showing up, you can get to it <a href="http://gist.github.com/278148">directly on Github</a>.</p>
