<p>Tibco <a href="http://www.tibco.com/company/news/releases/2008/press924.jsp">acquired Insightful </a>last year.  Many folks have reported that S-Plus (the closed source implementation of the S language) was dang near financially killed by the success of R (the open source implementation of the S language).  I may be slow on the update, but today I learned that a company named <a href="http://teamwpc.co.uk/products/wps">World Programming </a>is making a product, WPS, which is an alternative implementation of the SAS base language. WPS costs a small fraction of what SAS charges. In addition, a smart chap named Phil Rack has created a program for WPS called Bridge to R which, as the name implies, bridges WPS to R. In an <a href="http://www.decisionstats.com/2009/02/interview-phil-rack/">interview with Phil Rack on the blog Decision Stats</a>, Phil poins out that while WPS is only an alternative for base SAS and not the statistics tools like SAS/STAT, ETS, OR, etc by having a bridge to R a SAS programmer can get the data handling abilities of SAS and the statistical tools of R through WBS and R without having to pay our friends in North Carolina any cash. Very nice!</p>

<p>If there was only an open source implementation of the SAS language and base abilities&hellip; oh I can&rsquo;t even continue the thought. It&rsquo;s just too good to be true.</p>

<p>Kudos to Ajay at the blog <a href="http://www.decisionstats.com">Decision Stats </a>for opening my eyes to WPS.  Keep up the good work, Ajay. But I agree with Phil, if you have 6300 contacts in LinkedIn, you, my good man, are a link whore. Not that I have a problem with that.</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong></p>

<p>Let me clarify that I am not anti-SAS. SAS is a tool, and it does a good job at what it does. I learned to program SAS in grad school and used it for years, first in academia and later as a consultant.  However, I honestly believe that their licensing model is totally outdated and stifles innovation. I also know that I was VERY excited when my previous employer chose SAS as their BI provider. After over $500,000 in fees and 18 months we still had no BI system. That really pissed me off. After using R for a couple of years I now realize how good statistical programming can be and I don&rsquo;t miss SAS one bit. By effing up their BI build at my previous employeer, SAS forcefully pushed me into R. <em>sing</em> And that&rsquo;s the way we all became the Brady Bunch.. doo dee doot doot dooooo!</p>
