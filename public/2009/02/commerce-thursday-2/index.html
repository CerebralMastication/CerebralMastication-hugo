      <p>In keeping with my hit or miss tradition of recommending crap that you should buy, here&rsquo;s my next installment of Commerce Thursday&hellip; roll the theme music.</p>

<p>The first two items are software. At some point in the future I&rsquo;ll do an in depth discussion on how my use of multiple monitors makes me happy, if not more productive. In the meantime, here are two multi-monitor pieces of software that are NOT open source or free but you should go spend your hard earned dollars on them.</p>

<pre><code>  1. [MaxiVista ](http://www.maxivista.com/)- do you have two computers and wish you could use them like dual monitors on one computer? Maybe do a little remote control of one desktop using the other keyboard and mouse? If so, use MaxiVista.
  2. [UltraMon ](http://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/)- If you're running multiple monitors, either through MaxiVista or without, you need UltraMon. UM helps you manage desktops images, have a toolbar on each monitor, send windows from one desktop to another, etc. Blah blah blah buy it. Trust me. I have multiple degrees and a white lab coat.
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;d get off my lazy duff and do a screencast or movie or something, but MaxiVista already did a YouTube video. Good for them!</p>

<p>They really should give me a kickback. I bet I&rsquo;ll drive ones and ones of buyers to their site. Hey, I loved them both so much I bought the companies blogged about them.</p>

<p>In my opinion if you run MaxiVista you really need UltraMon as well. This is especially true if you run 3 monitors. With MaxiVista and 3 monitors I have noticed that when the screen saver kicks on, the monitor settings tend to get messed up. I find myself having to go into Windows video setup and move the relative position of the monitors around. UltraMon does a pretty good job of making sure that icons don&rsquo;t run away, settings don&rsquo;t change, and generally things behave right. About once every few days I find myself having to restart MaxiVista, but before UltraMon I had to restart MaxiVista 3-4 times a day.</p>

<p>And last, but not least, da beer. You seeing a trend here? Two data points makes a trend for me!</p>

<p>Yet another beer from Trader Joe&rsquo;s. The 2008 TJ&rsquo;s Vintage Ale brewed by Unibroue.Â  FWIW, Unibroue has always had my admiration for best brewery name. I always picture a Belgian guy with a single heavy eyebrow across his forehead and a mustache laced with beer foam.</p>

<p>I liked this beer so much I bought a case! I now call TJ&rsquo;s &lsquo;the liquor store that sells groceries&rsquo; at least I think they sell groceries. I&rsquo;m generally filling boxes with wine and beer.</p>
