      <p>My wife loves her iPhone. The thing she likes about it the most is that &ldquo;It Just Works.&rdquo; My wife should hire herself out to be a user interface and usability consultant. She is incredibly smart yet has a VERY short attention span.  If I am dicking around with some technology I will fiddle and fiddle and go have a beer and come back and fiddle and fiddle some more until I finally get it to work. I sort of expect that things are not going to work right and will have to be molested within an inch of their life. My wife sits down at a new piece of software and if she is not able to make it do her bidding in 5 minutes, she&rsquo;s done. Does this mean she knows everything about it in 5 minutes? Of course not, but she is having what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Sierra">Kathy Sierra</a> calls an &ldquo;I rule&rdquo; moment within 5 minutes or she is done.</p>

<p>This was her experience with iPhone. She was kicking ass in 5 minutes. Later as she uses her iPhone she keeps learning, but she never is up against a &ldquo;usability wall&rdquo; or having an experience where she thinks, &ldquo;This thing is keeping me from kicking the ass I want to kick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had a home PC fail and I thought I would see if I could switch Windows XP with Ubuntu without my wife caring. She was dubious, but she was a good sport and gave it a try. The second time she sat down at Ubuntu she wanted to ship a package using USPS.com. On their site she enters info and it returns a PDF shipping label embedded in a browser window.  She fills out the form, clicks the button, and &hellip; nothing. No request by Firefox to open a PDF, no error. No nothing. Just blank screen. Was this a fault of Ubuntu? Firefox on Linux? USPS.com? It doesn&rsquo;t really matter because she was done. XP got loaded on that machine that very night. I might have been able to dick around and figure out how to make it work, but my wife was done.</p>

<p>This is the future of customer service. It&rsquo;s a battle between increasingly complex systems and customers who want things to &ldquo;just work.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>PS</strong>:</p>

<p>So while I was writing this I googled &ldquo;it just works&rdquo; in quotes to see what comes up. One of the top hits was a technology site called www.itjustworks.com. Their mission statement is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>To provide computer and technology solutions to our clients in a manner and at a price that will bring them back and have them recommend us to others. </blockquote>

<p>And when I loaded their site it looks like this:</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_113&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;300&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;It Just Works!&rdquo;]<img src="https://www.cerebralmastication.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/itjustworks1-300x234.png" alt="It Just Works!" />
[/caption]</p>

<p>Oops, I use NoScript in Firefix to block scripting. Here let me turn that off:</p>

[/caption]</p>

<p>Still looks like hell, plus it has loud annoying music that loads with the Flash Animation. It just works&hellip; indeed!</p>
