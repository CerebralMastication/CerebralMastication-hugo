It blows my mind that organizations choose names and acronyms that have alternative, non-flattering meaning. I understand this when there is language translation involved. No one at Ford knew that Nova sounds just like &ldquo;no go&rdquo; in Spanish. I mean, it&rsquo;s Ford, they were educated in Detroit public schools. They don&rsquo;t speak Mexican. But take Virginia, for example. Like other states, VA gives school kids standardized exams. Every states has some acronym for these exams. In VA, that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym">TLA </a>is SOL. You got it, Virginia makes kids take the SOL exam to determine if they are, indeed, SOL.</p>

<p>I was reminded of this recently when reading about someone from the <a href="http://www.omg.org/">Object Management Group </a>giving a conference presentation. They were listed as Whitey McCracker, OMG, giving a speech on &ldquo;managing your objects in a functional object post internet paradigm (2.0).&rdquo; To which I simply thought, &ldquo;WTF does that mean? OMG that is hard to decipher. &ldquo;</p>

<p>I guess the bottom line is this, if you are thinking up a public acronym, be sure and run it by your 14 year old son to make sure it does not have an alternative meaning.</p>

<p>To battle the proliferation of TLAs I&rsquo;ve taken to just saying &ldquo;Whiskey Tango Foxtrot&rdquo; because I think it makes me sound cool, like that gay guy in TopGun.</p>
