      <p>Today I have a couple I want to print for reading later and I want to print them duplex so the stack of crap would be smaller. I need to go to Staples (the office supply store) later so I thought I would just use their online printing tool to print the document at their store and then pick it up when I go there later today. As with most sites they want a bunch of personal info from me so I diligently fill out 15 text boxes. As with most sites they want me to make a username and password. Fine. I use <a href="http://www.simprit.com/minisafe_bb/">MiniSafe desktop and MiniSafe Blackberry </a>app to keep my passwords straight. I also use a simple algorithm for password creation to keep things from getting too complex. I always use a number followed by a phrase followed by the name of the site. So for Staples I wanted to use the pass &lsquo;45JimmyCrackCorn_staples&rsquo;. I was shocked when the site returned an error saying the &ldquo;password is not strong&rdquo;</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_139&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;493&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Staples Wants More Entropy&rdquo;]<img src="https://www.cerebralmastication.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/staples_sux1.jpg" alt="staples_sux1" />
[/caption]</p>

<p>This blows my mind. My password is 24 characters long, contains numbers, mixed case,Â  and punctuation yet they think it is not strong? Damn. So I try again with a new routine adding more numbers more punctuation. Same error. Finally I used MiniSafe to produce a 30 character random password which I appended with &ldquo;_staples&rdquo;. Here&rsquo;s the password:</p>

<blockquote>r!-MzZDsXhczm&m#$@L%25HXw66cnb_staples</blockquote>

<p>Looks friggin&rsquo; strong to me! But not to staples.com. I got the same error. I am left to conclude that Staples.com requires a password that does not contain the string &ldquo;staples&rdquo;. There is no warning of this. But since I entered a password with more entropy than Lyle Lovet&rsquo;s hair I can only assume that the presence of the string &ldquo;staples&rdquo; causes the site to reject my password.</p>

<p>So after trial and error led me to this conclusion I chose a password without the forbidden string in it. Which password did I choose? The following:</p>

<blockquote>password</blockquote>

<p>Yep, and staples.com took it without so much as a warning. Nice ey? And their backup question about the name of my first dog? Yeah, his name was Rex. So my password is &lsquo;password&rsquo; and my first dog is Rex. But my password with over 138 bits of entropy was rejected. I&rsquo;m going to Office Max.</p>

<p><!-- more -->Technical Detail:</p>

<p>If you want to know how many bits of strength or entropy a password has, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength">Wikipedia article on password strength</a> is a great place to start. My 30 character password was created with a generator that used all alphabet characters upper and lower case (26*2), all numbers (10) and 10 punctuation marks for a total of 72 possibilities for each of the 30 characters. To calculate the entropy I used the formula from Wikipedia and got:</p>

<p>30 * Log2(72) = 185.1</p>
