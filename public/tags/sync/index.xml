      <description>I love the portability of a laptop. I have a 45 min train ride twice a day and I fly a little too, so having my work with me on my laptop is very important. But I hate doing long running analytics on my laptop when I&amp;rsquo;m in the office because it bogs down my laptop and all those videos on The Superficial get all jerky and stuff.
I get around this conundrum by running much of my analytics on either my work server or on an EC2 machine (I&amp;rsquo;m going to call these collectively &amp;ldquo;my servers&amp;rdquo; for the rest of this post).</description>
