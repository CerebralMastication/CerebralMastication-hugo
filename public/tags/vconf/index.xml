      <description>On Tuesday May 4th at 9:30 PM central, 10:30 eastern, I&amp;rsquo;ll be giving a live online presentation as part of the Vconf.org open conference series. I&amp;rsquo;ll be speaking about R and why I started using R a couple years ago. This is NOT going to be a technical presentation but rather an illustration of how an R convert was created and why R became part of my daily tool set.</description>
