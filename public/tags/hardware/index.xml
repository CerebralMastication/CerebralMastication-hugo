My wife and I bought a foreclosed house a few months ago. This house had been part of mortgage fraud and we bought it at auction. Interesting life experience, to say the least. The finished basement was built with radiant heat tubing poured into the concrete. These pipes are designed to be hooked to a hot water heater so the warm water can provide radiant heat through the floors in the basement.</description>

      <description>As an economist who has a fascination with open source software, I found this article in Wired about microfinance lending for open source hardware totally engaging. Regulatory issues are clearly an issue for these guys. From the article:
Hacking hardware is totally unregulated. As soon as they start organized finance it starts getting hard fast. I hope someone who understands regulation can help these guys out. They have a very interesting idea.</description>
