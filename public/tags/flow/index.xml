      <description>It geeky circles there&amp;rsquo;s often talk of finding your &amp;ldquo;flow.&amp;rdquo; The term was coined by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in his book Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience and which he revisits in the smaller and more readable Finding Flow: The Psychology of Engagement with Everyday Life. The general idea is finding the state where you lose yourself in what you are doing and find the experience fun, enjoyable, and productive. There&amp;rsquo;s even a Wikipedia article on the topic of flow.</description>
