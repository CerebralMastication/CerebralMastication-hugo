      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m kinda blown away by the number of folks who have joined the Chicago R User Group (RUG) in the last few weeks. As of this morning we have 65 people signed up for the group and 25 who have said that they are planning on attending the meetup this Thursday (yes, only 3 days away!) I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased that this many people in Chicago find the R language interesting and/or valuable.</description>
