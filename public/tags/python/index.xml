      <description>I was recently asked about using sympy in Python to print \(LaTeX\) formulas in RMarkdown notebooks. I misunderstood the question at first but after some thought I realized that I didn’t know if it would work… but I should try it.
Yes, printing elements of a matrix. So it&#39;s due to the prog languages&#39; differences ( R vs Python), not rmarkdown vs Jupyter Notebook? pic.twitter.com/Any4qIDHS7 — Eyayaw T. Beze (@EyayawBeze) July 25, 2020   I knew that I could run Python chunks in an RMarkdown notebook.</description>

      <description>I just spent nearly two full days in a bare knuckle brawl with my Macbook Pro trying to get it to talk to a corporate MS SQL Server. I had abandoned MSSQL more than a year ago in favor of PostgreSQL because of how much easier it is to work with PostgreSQL from a non-Microsoft stack. At that point I was R running on Linux and soon R running on OS X.</description>
