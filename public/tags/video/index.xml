      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a huge O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Media fan boy. I can&amp;rsquo;t hide it. I hear Tim O&amp;rsquo;Reilly speak at conferences and I think to myself, &amp;ldquo;Screw being president, I want to be Tim O&amp;rsquo;Reilly.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve been a subscriber to their online book services called Safari Books Online for years. Every month I see the bill for $43 come through and I think to myself, &amp;ldquo;Self, that&amp;rsquo;s the best $43 you spent all month.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s common knowledge that I struggle wrapping my head around the apply functions in R. That is illustrated very clearly in the following discussion on Stack Overflow:

Dirk&amp;rsquo;s comment is actually spot on. I&amp;rsquo;ve asked the same damn question at least 4-5 times. Only I didn&amp;rsquo;t really understand it was the same question. That&amp;rsquo;s one of the problems of not really being good at something; it&amp;rsquo;s hard to think abstractly about it.</description>

      <description>When he&amp;rsquo;s not sitting around thinking about how sexy statisticians areI am, he apparently gives speaking engagements. Who knew? Here&amp;rsquo;s a video of him saying stuff about managing &amp;ldquo;knowledge workers.&amp;rdquo; I believe that &amp;ldquo;knowledge workers&amp;rdquo; is a euphemism for &amp;ldquo;people who like to play video games.&amp;rdquo; I could be wrong, but not likely.</description>

      <title>&#39;Sully&#39; Sullenberger voice recordings</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard all the stories about how &amp;lsquo;Sully&amp;rsquo; Sullenberger has to go through a special line at the airport because his large brass balls always set off the metal detectors. Well. It&amp;rsquo;s true, and here&amp;rsquo;s proof:
Ever since Sept 15th, 2008 I have had a bit of a fetish with studying accident theory (that&amp;rsquo;s when our financial system started its current free fall). One of the best books I have read on how big studs like Sully make decisions is the book Sources of Power by Gary Klein.</description>

      <description>Let me start by saying that I like Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Benoît Mandelbrot quite a lot. I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with them all the time, but that is generally true of people I like. I recall reading Mandelbrot&amp;rsquo;s book The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulencesome years ago and being struck by how much sense Mandelbrot makes. It helped that his early work related to markets was in cotton prices and I am an agricultural economist.</description>
