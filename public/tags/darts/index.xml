      <description>Back in November 2009 Wired wrote an article about some grad students who decided to try to stochastically model throwing darts. Because I don&amp;rsquo;t actually read printed material I didn&amp;rsquo;t see the article until a couple of months ago. My immediate thought was, &amp;ldquo;hey, I drink beer. I throw darts. I build stochastic models. Why haven&amp;rsquo;t I done this?&amp;rdquo; Well we all know why I haven&amp;rsquo;t done this. I have a job and a 2 year old daughter and I like my wife.</description>
