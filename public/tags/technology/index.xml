      <description>My wife loves her iPhone. The thing she likes about it the most is that &amp;ldquo;It Just Works.&amp;rdquo; My wife should hire herself out to be a user interface and usability consultant. She is incredibly smart yet has a VERY short attention span.Â If I am dicking around with some technology I will fiddle and fiddle and go have a beer and come back and fiddle and fiddle some more until I finally get it to work.</description>
