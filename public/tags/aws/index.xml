      <description>A bad analogy can frame an entire conversation improperly. This is one of those &amp;ldquo;anecdotes from a middle-aged man posts.&amp;rdquo; So take it with a grain of salt.
A number of years ago I worked in the risk management team for an insurance company that sold long term care (LTC) insurance. LTC insurance is a private product that covers home health care and nursing home care if the policyholder is unable to take care of themselves on their own.</description>

Using the command line tools means each tool has to be configured individually which is painful on a new machine.</description>

      <description>I do some work from home, some work from an office in Chicago and some work on the road. It&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon for me to want to tunnel all my web traffic through a VPN tunnel.
