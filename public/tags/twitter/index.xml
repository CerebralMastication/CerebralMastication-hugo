      <description>So one glace at my user logs shows the truth: no one gives a rat&amp;rsquo;s rump thatI just quit my job; you just love you some Twitter R code. And I&amp;rsquo;m nothing but an attention whore, so come get some!
So in mylast &amp;lsquo;Twitter with R&amp;rsquo; post I gave you some code I&amp;rsquo;d written ripped off that allowed you to update your status from R. That&amp;rsquo;s kinda cool, but really just for annoying your friends, tweeting when your code is finished running or, as Eva pointed out in the comments, maybe Tweeting the outcome of a routine.</description>

      <description>So I have started following the #RStats tag in twitter. Prior to a week ago I had never Twitterbated so I thought I would give it a go since I am not one to shy away from new technology&amp;hellip; much. I think of Twitter like a call in radio show where I get to cut off callers when they annoy me.
Well one of the interesting things I ran across was this tweet that pointed to this page about posting tweets from R.</description>
