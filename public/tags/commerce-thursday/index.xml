      <description>In keeping with my hit or miss tradition of recommending crap that you should buy, here&amp;rsquo;s my next installment of Commerce Thursday&amp;hellip; roll the theme music.
The first two items are software. At some point in the future I&amp;rsquo;ll do an in depth discussion on how my use of multiple monitors makes me happy, if not more productive. In the meantime, here are two multi-monitor pieces of software that are NOT open source or free but you should go spend your hard earned dollars on them.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Thursday, time for a list of crap that you can buy which I have gotten great use out of this week. Be like me, buy some junk!

Acer X243w monitor. 24&amp;rdquo; of monitor madness! I&amp;rsquo;ve had this monitor for a couple of weeks and love it. It is my middle monitor in my three monitor array. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to share more about my feelings about multiple monitors later.</description>
