      <description>Today (March 24th) is Ada Lovelace day. It&amp;rsquo;s a day to remember that chicks dig technology and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to have a penis to be a geek. Mom, I know you find that hard to believe but it&amp;rsquo;s true.
So part of Ada Lovelace day is to blog about women in technology. I love technology. I love women. I have a daughter named Ada whom I love. So it seems like I am more qualified than most to blog about women in tech.</description>
