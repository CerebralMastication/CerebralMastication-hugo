It's been pointed out to me that I haven't had any blog posts in a while. It's true. I'm fairly slack. But in the last few months I've changed jobs (same firm, new role), written an R abstraction on top of Hadoop, been to China, and managed to stay married. While that sounds pretty awesome, I'm nothing compared to [Hideaki Akaiwa](http://www.badassoftheweek.com/akaiwa.html).

And you may have heard that the R Cookbook by Chicago's own Paul Teeter has been printed! Way to go Paul! And for a limited time you can get the book 50% off [direct from O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com/store/dd-jpn.html).

And let it be known: I've double dog dared you to find a stats or programming book with any better back cover quotes:
