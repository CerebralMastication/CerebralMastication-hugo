I think we all know that Morris Day was talking about when he wrote the lyrics to "The Bird":


<blockquote>Yes! Hold on now, this dance ain't for everybody.
Just the sexy people.
White folks, you're much too tight.
You gotta shake your head like the black folks.
You might get some tonight.
Look out!</blockquote>


That's right, he was talking about the new [R User Group in Chicago](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRUG/)! a.k.a Chicago RUG! We know that R is sexy because [statistical analysis is sexy](https://www.cerebralmastication.com/2009/02/hal-varian-google%E2%80%99s-chief-economist-thinks-i-am-sexy/). That is, if you're doing it right! Even Mike Driscol at Dataspora knows that [Data Geeks have to get their sexy on](http://dataspora.com/blog/sexy-data-geeks/).Â  There is no doubt that Chicago is sexy. The second city is so damned sexy that Karen Abbott wrote [_Sin in the Second City _](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812975995?ie=UTF8&tag=riskthou-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0812975995)and managed to get it on the NYT best sellers list. She makes me reconsider my agrarian interpretation of Chicago's "meat packing" heritage. _***rim shot* **_Thank you, thank you._** **_I'll be here all week. Try the veal!_**

If you're in Chicagoland and reading this blog then you have every reason to get over to the [Chicago R User Group web site ](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRUG/)and sign up! I'm looking forward to meeting all the Chicago R users in the near future. In case you're afraid you won't recognize me I'll be the one that looks just like Morris Day... only white... and not as well dressed... and kinda nerdy. But otherwise, just like Morris.

Now shut up and dance!
