Stop wasting time reading my drivel. You need to head over the the DataWrangling.com blog and [read Peter Skomoroch's interview with Bradford Cross ](http://www.datawrangling.com/how-flightcaster-squeezes-predictions-from-flight-data)of [FlightCaster](http://www.flightcaster.com/).

Peter wrote up this interview back in August 2009, so I'm a little late to this party. There's some really great quotes in this interview. Here's a few of my fav quotes from Cross:


<blockquote>At Google, the research scientists prototype in python and R, and then port to C++ for the real scalable map reduce runs.</blockquote>




<blockquote>Building layer upon layer of abstraction is a big key...    The technical term for this is “wrap the crap.”</blockquote>


Here's a problem I think anyone who works with data and models can relate to:


<blockquote>I made a lot of mistakes early in my career in building trading models where I let me theories get too far ahead of what I could really test in practice. That is not a good place to be. Unfortunately, this is an easy mistake to make.</blockquote>
