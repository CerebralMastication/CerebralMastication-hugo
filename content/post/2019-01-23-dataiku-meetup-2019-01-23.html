<p>Tonight Iâ€™m presenting at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Analytics-Data-Science-by-Dataiku-NY/events/257347488/">Dataiku Analytics and Data Science Meetup</a>. My presentation is an adaptation of what I presented at RStudio::conf(2019) but with an emphasis towards a non-R audience. The <a href="/prez/2019_01_dataiku.html">slides are here</a>. I have about 5-10 min more time at Dataiku than I had at RStudio::conf so I added a few slides showing off R Markdown and data exchange between R and Python. I thought those might be interesting and new to a non-R focused audience.</p>
