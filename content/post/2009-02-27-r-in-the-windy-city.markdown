In honor of me moving to Chicago, the powers who abide have decided to hold the first annual "R/Finance conference for applied finance using R" conference in Chicago this year. The dates are April 24-25, 2009.

[R/Finance 2009: Applied Finance with R](http://www.rinfinance.com/)

To those who made the decision on location, I'm pleased but slightly embarrassed that you let my relocation decision have such a profound impact on your venue choice.

And to the three readers that feedburner tells me regularly read this blog (hi Mom), if you are attending this conference please let me know and I'll buy you a beer or three.
