Tonight (October 29, 2009) at 5:30 PM is the Chicago R meetup at Jaks tap. [Here's more info](http://www.nabble.com/R-CMD---meetup%3DChicago---when%3DOct-29---where%3DJak'sTap-td25873425.html).Â  I'll be making a presentation based on my [earlier blog post about plyr](https://www.cerebralmastication.com/?p=339). The presentation will only be 8 minutes long so I've had to pick and choose my info carefully. OK, who am I kidding? I had a couple of Schlitz (in a bottle!) for lunch over at [Boni Vinos](http://chicago.menupages.com/restaurants/boni-vino/) and slammed some slides together rather haphazardly. At any rate, here's the presentation. I owe special thanks to all the folks in Twitter who reviewed these slides this week. A special shout out to [@kenahoo](http://twitter.com/kenahoo/status/5237929377) who caught my one code typo! And also to [@hadleywickham](http://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/5235012169) (author of plyr) who made some good suggestions, some of which I heeded. As a professor he should consider 15% application of his information to be a phenomenally high rate.

If you're wondering what my favorite beer is, I'll give you a secret. My favorite beer is #3. That's the one that makes me a persuasive and articulate public speaker. #4 makes me dance well.

I hope to see you tonight.
