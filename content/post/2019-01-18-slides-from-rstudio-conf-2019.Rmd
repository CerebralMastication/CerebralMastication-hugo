I had amazingly positive feedback from my presentation on "Empathy in Action" today at [rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) in Austin. My main focus was emphasizing that most business users don't want to learn to code. They just want to kick ass. And coding can be a means to that end. 

While I'd like to think the response was because of my fantastic choice of GIFs illustrating what analysts do for a living:

```{r g1, fig.cap='Analyst in Action file', echo=FALSE, out.width='75%', class='image_shadow'}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/fire_deadlift.gif")
```

The real reason it was so memorable, however, was the wonderful custom images from [Allison Horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst?lang=en). Alison's sad and happy apps really stole the show! 

```{r g2, fig.cap='A Sad Office', echo=FALSE, out.width='75%', class='image_shadow'}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/Sad_Cubicles_2.png")
```

```{r g3, fig.cap='My Office', echo=FALSE, out.width='75%', class='image_shadow'}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/Office-R-github.png")
```

Thank you Allison for your cute/fun/awesome drawings! They helped make the story more fun to tell.
