My wife loves her iPhone. The thing she likes about it the most is that "It Just Works." My wife should hire herself out to be a user interface and usability consultant. She is incredibly smart yet has a VERY short attention span.  If I am dicking around with some technology I will fiddle and fiddle and go have a beer and come back and fiddle and fiddle some more until I finally get it to work. I sort of expect that things are not going to work right and will have to be molested within an inch of their life. My wife sits down at a new piece of software and if she is not able to make it do her bidding in 5 minutes, she's done. Does this mean she knows everything about it in 5 minutes? Of course not, but she is having what [Kathy Sierra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Sierra) calls an "I rule" moment within 5 minutes or she is done.

This was her experience with iPhone. She was kicking ass in 5 minutes. Later as she uses her iPhone she keeps learning, but she never is up against a "usability wall" or having an experience where she thinks, "This thing is keeping me from kicking the ass I want to kick."

We had a home PC fail and I thought I would see if I could switch Windows XP with Ubuntu without my wife caring. She was dubious, but she was a good sport and gave it a try. The second time she sat down at Ubuntu she wanted to ship a package using USPS.com. On their site she enters info and it returns a PDF shipping label embedded in a browser window.  She fills out the form, clicks the button, and ... nothing. No request by Firefox to open a PDF, no error. No nothing. Just blank screen. Was this a fault of Ubuntu? Firefox on Linux? USPS.com? It doesn't really matter because she was done. XP got loaded on that machine that very night. I might have been able to dick around and figure out how to make it work, but my wife was done.

This is the future of customer service. It's a battle between increasingly complex systems and customers who want things to "just work."

**PS**:

So while I was writing this I googled "it just works" in quotes to see what comes up. One of the top hits was a technology site called www.itjustworks.com. Their mission statement is as follows:


<blockquote>To provide computer and technology solutions to our clients in a manner and at a price that will bring them back and have them recommend us to others. </blockquote>


And when I loaded their site it looks like this:

Oops, I use NoScript in Firefix to block scripting. Here let me turn that off:

Still looks like hell, plus it has loud annoying music that loads with the Flash Animation. It just works... indeed!
