](http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2009/03/open-source-har.html)As an economist who has a fascination with open source software, I found this article in [Wired about microfinance lending for open source hardware ](http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2009/03/open-source-har.html)totally engaging. Regulatory issues are clearly an issue for these guys. From the article:


<blockquote>Zopa's Pitts agrees that the Open Source Hardware Bank needs to figure out how to navigate through the financial rules of the U.S. market. "These guys do not have a regulatory strategy and they need one," he says.</blockquote>


Hacking hardware is totally unregulated. As soon as they start organized finance it starts getting hard fast. I hope someone who understands regulation can help these guys out. They have a very interesting idea.
