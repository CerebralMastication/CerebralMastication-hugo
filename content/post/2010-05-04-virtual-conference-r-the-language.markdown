On Tuesday May 4th at 9:30 PM central, 10:30 eastern, I'll be giving a [live online presentation](http://vconf.org/presentation/r-the-language/) as part of the Vconf.org open conference series. I'll be speaking about R and why I started using R a couple years ago. This is NOT going to be a technical presentation but rather an illustration of how an R convert was created and why R became part of my daily tool set.

If your not familiar with the vconf.org project, you should [read a little about it](http://vconf.org/be-a-speaker/). It's just getting started but I love the idea that it's not for profit and all presentations are Creative Commons license. You know that cool new technology you've been playing with? Yeah that one. You really should give a vconf about it. I know I'd like to hear about it!
