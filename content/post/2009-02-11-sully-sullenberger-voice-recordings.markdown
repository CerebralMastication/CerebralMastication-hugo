We've all heard all the stories about how 'Sully' Sullenberger has to go through a special line at the airport because his large brass balls always set off the metal detectors. Well. It's true, and here's proof:



Ever since Sept 15th, 2008 I have had a bit of a fetish with studying accident theory (that's when our financial system started its current free fall).Â  One of the best books I have read on how big studs like Sully make decisions is the book [_Sources of Power_ by Gary Klein](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262611465?ie=UTF8&tag=riskthou-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0262611465). Mr Klein helps us understand how critical descionmakers think under fire (both literal and figurative). It's definitly worth reading.
