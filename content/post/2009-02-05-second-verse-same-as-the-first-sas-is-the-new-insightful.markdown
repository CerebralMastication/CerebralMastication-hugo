Tibco [acquired Insightful ](http://www.tibco.com/company/news/releases/2008/press924.jsp)last year.  Many folks have reported that S-Plus (the closed source implementation of the S language) was dang near financially killed by the success of R (the open source implementation of the S language).  I may be slow on the update, but today I learned that a company named [World Programming ](http://teamwpc.co.uk/products/wps)is making a product, WPS, which is an alternative implementation of the SAS base language. WPS costs a small fraction of what SAS charges. In addition, a smart chap named Phil Rack has created a program for WPS called Bridge to R which, as the name implies, bridges WPS to R. In an [interview with Phil Rack on the blog Decision Stats](http://www.decisionstats.com/2009/02/interview-phil-rack/), Phil poins out that while WPS is only an alternative for base SAS and not the statistics tools like SAS/STAT, ETS, OR, etc by having a bridge to R a SAS programmer can get the data handling abilities of SAS and the statistical tools of R through WBS and R without having to pay our friends in North Carolina any cash. Very nice!

If there was only an open source implementation of the SAS language and base abilities... oh I can't even continue the thought. It's just too good to be true.

Kudos to Ajay at the blog [Decision Stats ](http://www.decisionstats.com)for opening my eyes to WPS.  Keep up the good work, Ajay. But I agree with Phil, if you have 6300 contacts in LinkedIn, you, my good man, are a link whore. Not that I have a problem with that.

**PS:**

Let me clarify that I am not anti-SAS. SAS is a tool, and it does a good job at what it does. I learned to program SAS in grad school and used it for years, first in academia and later as a consultant.  However, I honestly believe that their licensing model is totally outdated and stifles innovation. I also know that I was VERY excited when my previous employer chose SAS as their BI provider. After over $500,000 in fees and 18 months we still had no BI system. That really pissed me off. After using R for a couple of years I now realize how good statistical programming can be and I don't miss SAS one bit. By effing up their BI build at my previous employeer, SAS forcefully pushed me into R. *sing* And that's the way we all became the Brady Bunch.. doo dee doot doot dooooo!
