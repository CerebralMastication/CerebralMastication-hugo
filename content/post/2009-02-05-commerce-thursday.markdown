It's Thursday, time for a list of crap that you can buy which I have gotten great use out of this week. Be like me, buy some junk!

[Acer X243w monitor](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E563OM?ie=UTF8&tag=riskthou-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001E563OM). 24" of monitor madness! I've had this monitor for a couple of weeks and love it. It is my middle monitor in my three monitor array. I'll have to share more about my feelings about multiple monitors later. The link here is to Amazon, where it is currently $224 thorough one of their affiliate stores. But watch the Sunday ads for specials at the office supply stores and check online [GotApex.com ](GotApex.com )as well. Anything around $200 is a great price on a 24" monitor. If I can get one at Circuit City's clearance for under $200 I'll probably get one or two more. Don't tell my wife.

[Grippa Slip Pen ](http://www.bookmarkpen.com/grippaslippens.html)- Yes it sounds odd, but I love these little things. I keep a [grid paper moleskin ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001A0JRWG?ie=UTF8&tag=riskthou-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001A0JRWG)notebook (the Moleskin folks call the little graph paper book a 'Squared Cahier Journal.' Sounds like something a terrorist would carry.) in my pocket most of the time and these slim pens are a heck of a lot more comfortable to sit on than a normal ball point pen. They don't call them ball points for nothing! Zing! (Get it? Ball=testicles. Pretty witty, no?)

Stockyard oatmeal stout: Brewed by Goose Island, sold at Trader Joe's, drunk by me. If you like stouts/porters that have a nice burned finish, you should give this a try. Not a smooth finish like Guinness, but a nice burned taste like the last little bit of chocolate fondu! It's fantastic!

That's it for this week. No go be a patriot and go buy some stuff. Remember, if you pay off your credit card balance, the terrorists win!
