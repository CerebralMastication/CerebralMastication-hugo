<p>I recently wanted to run <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Apache Airflow</a> on my laptop as an upgrade to <code>cron</code>. I don’t really want all the full power and fury that Airflow brings, but I’m not one to shy away from killing a gnat with a sledge hammer.</p>
<p>I use <code>conda</code> to manage environments on my mac and I wanted to keep airflow in a conda environment. So I ran the following which sets up a conda environment called <code>airflow</code> then installs airflow in that environment.</p>
<pre><code>## create and activate conda environment
conda create -n airflow pip setuptools python=3.6
conda activate airflow

## set environment var and install airflow
export AIRFLOW_GPL_UNIDECODE=yes
pip install &quot;apache-airflow[s3, postgres]&quot;

## start airflow scheduler and webserver as daemons
airflow scheduler -D
airflow webserver -D</code></pre>
<p>Boom, you’ve now got Airflow up and running. Point a browser at <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and you should see the Airflow admin page.</p>
<p>The Airflow services (scheduler and webserver) are running with your permissions and in your user directory.</p>
<p>Every workflow in airflow is defined as a DAG. A DAG is a single Python file that defines the different pieces of a workflow and the order and dependency between them. For my use case I only wanted Airflow to run a single R script on my machine. For this, I created a new file in <code>~/jal/airflow/dags/</code> and I named it <code>run_r_script.py</code>.</p>
<p>The contents of that file are as follows:</p>
<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

from builtins import range
from datetime import timedelta
import airflow
from airflow.models import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator
from airflow.operators.dummy_operator import DummyOperator

args = {
    &#39;owner&#39;: &#39;jal&#39;,
    &#39;start_date&#39;: airflow.utils.dates.days_ago(2),
}

dag = DAG(
    dag_id=&#39;r_etl&#39;,
    default_args=args,
    schedule_interval=&#39;* 4 * * *&#39;,
    dagrun_timeout=timedelta(minutes=20),
)

run_this = BashOperator(
    task_id=&#39;r_etl&#39;,
    bash_command=&#39;~/Documents/my_proj/r_etl.sh &#39;,
    dag=dag,
)

run_this 

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    dag.cli()</code></pre>
<p>There are a bunch of types of DAGs you can create in Airflow, but I just want to run an R script, so I created a <code>BashOperator</code> DAG. Most of what is in the DAG you can worry about understanding later. But there are two items worth noting immediately:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>bash_command='~/Documents/my_proj/r_etl.sh '</code> – this is the bash command this script executes. we’ll look at the contents next. Notice that there’s a bloody space after the name of the script but before the single quote. Yeah that <strong><em>HAS</em></strong> to be there. (Really Airflow?)</li>
<li><code>schedule_interval='* 4 * * *'</code> – this is the schedule in crontab format. I’m not well versed in crontab nomenclature, so I used <a href="https://crontab-generator.org/" class="uri">https://crontab-generator.org/</a> to help me figure out that <code>* 4 * * *</code> means “run this junk at 4AM every day”</li>
</ol>
<p>My <code>'~/Documents/my_proj/r_etl.sh</code> is an <code>Rscript</code> shell script that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/local/bin/Rscript

setwd(&#39;/Users/jal/Documents/my_proj/&#39;)
source(&#39;/Users/jal/Documents/my_proj/my_etl_junk.R&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Make sure you’ve run <code>chmod +x ~/Documents/my_proj/r_etl.sh</code> after creating the file so that it’s executable.</p>
<p>My file <code>my_etl_junk.R</code> is the script that I want to run every morning. The shell script only sets the working directory then sources <code>my_etl_junk.R</code>. This way I don’t have any working directory junk cluttering up my main R script.</p>
<p>After you add these files, then Airflow should be ready to run your job. To give it a test, click the run icon which will trigger the DAG to run immediatly:</p>

<img src="/images/airflow_runlink.png" alt="Trigger DAG" width="75%" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you want to see the output of your DAG, you’ll want to go into the menu bar and click <code>Browse -&gt; Task Instances</code>:</p>
<div class="image_shadow">
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:task-instance"></span>
<img src="/images/airflow_task_instance.png" alt="Airflow Browse -&gt; Task Instances" width="75%" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then look all the way to the right and there’s a link that will take you to the log output.</p>
<div class="image_shadow">
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:loglink"></span>
<img src="/images/airflow_log_link.png" alt="Airflow Log URL" width="75%" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the log you should see all the output created by your R script.</p>
If you want to start Airflow every time you log in, the easiest thing to do is create a new Automator script:
<div class="image_shadow">
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:run-shell"></span>
<img src="/images/start_airflow_app.png" alt="Automator Run Shell Script" width="75%" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The source of that script took me a minute to figure out as I had to put in a magic conda line at the beginning. Obviously you’ll need to change your userid and location of <code>conda</code> if it’s not in the same place as mine.</p>
<pre><code>. /Users/jal/anaconda2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh

conda activate airflow
airflow scheduler -D
airflow webserver -D</code></pre>
Then assign that Automator script to run every time you log in:
<div class="image_shadow">
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:automatorrun"></span>
<img src="/images/airflow_startitem.png" alt="Run every log in" width="75%" />
<p class="caption">

<p>Have fun with Airflow!</p>
