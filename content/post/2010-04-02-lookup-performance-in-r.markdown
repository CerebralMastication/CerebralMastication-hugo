Rumor has it that Joe Adler, author of the O'Reilly Book [R in a Nutshell](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059680170X?ie=UTF8&tag=riskthou-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=059680170X), has joined Linked In as a data scientist.Â  But that does not keep him from still pumping out some interesting content over at OReilly.com. His [latest article is about lookup performance in R](http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2010/03/lookup-performance-in-r.html). He does a great job giving code samples and explaining what he is doing. Worth reading, for sure.
