Since I am an economist and not a computer scientist I sometimes feel like I'm not a real programmer, even though I spend hours hacking together bad code. One of my feelings of inadequacy is that all my programs seem to spend 85% of the time on what I have come to call "plumbing" and only 15% on actually doing useful stuff. According to this quote I [ran across today](http://www.geocities.com/krishna_kunchith/misc/bscs.html), I'm way better than average:


<blockquote>Less than 10% of the code has to do with the ostensible purpose of the   system; the rest deals with input-output, data validation, data structure   maintenance, and other housekeeping.

Ahhh.... I'm gooood. Beer time, baby!
