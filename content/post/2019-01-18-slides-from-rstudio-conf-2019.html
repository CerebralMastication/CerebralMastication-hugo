<p>I had amazingly positive feedback from my repsentation today at rstudio::conf in Austin. While I’d like to think the response was because of my fantastic choice of GIFs illustrating what analysts do for a living:</p>
<div class="image_shadow">
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:g1"></span>
<img src="/images/fire_deadlift.gif" alt="Analyst in Action file" width="75%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1: Analyst in Action file
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The real reason it was so memorable, however, was the wonderful custom images from <a href="https://twitter.com/allison_horst?lang=en">Allison Horst</a>. Alison’s sad and happy apps really stole the show!</p>
<div class="image_shadow">
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:g2"></span>
<img src="/images/Sad_Cubicles_2.png" alt="A Sad Office" width="75%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2: A Sad Office
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="image_shadow">
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:g3"></span>
<img src="/images/Office-R-github.png" alt="My Office" width="75%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 3: My Office
</p>
</div>

<p>Thank you Allison for your cute/fun/awesome drawings! They helped make the story more fun to tell.</p>
