Hey, y'all. I'm JD Long the Masticator in Residence at CerebralMastication.com. This is a dumping grounds for my thoughts and pontification on analytics, data, data science, risk analytics, and miscellany. 

What's my background? Well my career arc is captured over on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesdlong/). And I do a bit of public speaking so I've left some artifacts around over the years:

### DataFramed Podcast

My friend, Hugo Bowne-Anderson graciously invited me to speak with him on the [DataFramed podcast from DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/data-science-insurance). We discussed my background with risk, insurance, and why you should "plot your damn data!" Hugo was a great interviewer and much fun to chat with:

### Intro to `dplyr`

In the Spring of 2018 I presented an intro to the R package `dplyr` at the NYC Open Data Science Group hosted by Google: [Intro to `dplyr` presented at Google NYC]

### History of the [r] tag on Stack Overflow

In March 2017 I was a guest on the rOpenSci Community Call where I presented "The History of the [r] tag on Stack Overflow." Which tells the story of how a number of people organized to populate Stack Overflow with *R* questions and answers.

### Empathy as a Technical Skill

In May 2017 I shared some thoughts about how empathy with the audience for (and subjects of) our analysis can make us better data scientists.

### That R in Finance lightning talk that rhymed

There are rumors circulating that in 2011 I gave a presentation at the R in Finance conference in Chicago where my entire presentation was in Dr. Seuss style rhyme. Those rumors are true:

Have questions or suggestions? [Yell at me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/CMastication). The source code for this blog is all availiable on [my Github Account](https://github.com/CerebralMastication/CerebralMastication-hugo). I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), so when I change the contents of the Github repo, the site is rebuilt by Netlify using the latest source from Github. It's an amazing workflow and if you do websites and use *R*, it's hard to beat the Hugo/Blogdown/Netlify combination.
