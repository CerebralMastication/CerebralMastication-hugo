Hey, y'all. I'm JD Long the Masticator in Residence at CerebralMastication.com. This is a dumping grounds for my thoughts and pontification on analytics, data, data science, risk analytics, and miscellany. 

What's my background? Well my career arc is captured over on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesdlong/). And I do a bit of public speaking so I've managed to leave some artifacts around over the years:

### In the Spring of 2018 I presented an intro to the R package `dplyr` at the NYC Open Data Science Group: [Intro to `dplyr` presented at Google NYC] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOvN3wPdQoM&feature=youtu.be&t=11m50s)
