Hey, y'all. I'm JD Long the Masticator in Residence at CerebralMastication.com. This is a dumping grounds for my thoughts and pontification on analytics, data, data science, risk analytics, and miscellany. 

Various artifacts I've left laying around:

## [Intro to `dplyr` presented at Google NYC] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOvN3wPdQoM&feature=youtu.be&t=11m50s)

## Setup

Some fun facts about [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/):

* Built in [Go](http://golang.org/)
* Loosely inspired by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* Primarily developed by [spf13](http://spf13.com/) on the train while commuting to and from Manhattan.
* Coded in [Vim](http://vim.org) using [spf13-vim](http://vim.spf13.com/)

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/new) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/spf13).
